Enter the room

walk towards to the chair

Draw some pic on the picture, I draw a picture of dog on the paper

suddenly I drop the pencil on the floor under the chair, but I pick up the pencil and put down the pencil on the table

I drink a glass of water

I eat some bread

finally I lie down on the bed and go to sleep

Suddenly I loo a bird, the bird is cute and beautiful, so I want to draw a picture of the bird. I go back my room and pick up the pencil, draw a picture of the bird
