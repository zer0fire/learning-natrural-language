Today is the Thursday and I hope everything will be better, cause I'm so tired to process some problem. And I watch the video that teach me some English learning techniques by English teacher Tiffani, I think it's worked for me, I must keep focus on these techniques

After that, it's time to explain new words that I just learned it

gross, this word just looks like all
stiff, sth is dead and be hard
