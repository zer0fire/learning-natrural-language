Today is Monday, it is April First. today is cloudy and I suddenly realize it is Fool's day today, but I'm not interested to fool someone, I want to find some trick that other one made in this day. I saw the official site of Vue.js change its translation of Vue.js and it is very funny, another programmer joke, it is also made me think of a song called Daft Punk, fool, funny and punk.
