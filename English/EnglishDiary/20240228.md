Today is Wednesday, it's also the middle of the second work week. last night I watched the video about Duolingo test, and then I watched some English technical video of a Next.js contributor. I also make a test about my vocabulary and my grammar. I plan to make a conclusion and find a new video to watch today, make a conclusion and try to figure out the words problem, and I also plan to build my new dnd - drag and drop library in my local directory, and then I'll try to publish it. but first I need to make a plan about my work, maybe I should use the katex expression parsing result to build my render tree, and I also need to fixed the problem of font size in the template
