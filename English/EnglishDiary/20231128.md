Today is Tuesday, it is also sunny day, very beautiful sunny day but have some fogy and haze, maybe it isn't a good day but I also hope this day I can do something right or good. Last night I and my friend told about the sentence example, he told me he was learning the English sentence in common use, I think it's maybe a good idea for me to learning English in short-term, so I told him I want to join his group.
