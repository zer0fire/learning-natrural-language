Today is Monday, it is March eighteenth. I have two days to relax and I don't do more practice than writing diary or just take some conversation. Additionally last day I joined a mock interview as a listener, it is very interesting because I found that person, the interviewee maybe is the same-level with me, maybe something she is lower than me, something she is higher than me, but she is in the same-level basically. And after that the interviewer give her the interview performance. I will write it.

So overall her experience is very good. She is a person that is easy to communicate and follow and her English is very well. She did seem to have some difficulty with understanding some more intermediate words and concepts but I wasn't sure if that is because of the language barrier between english or if she is just a mid level developer.

She knew a lot about the questions that I asked and seemed to be well aware of everything from the Agile methodology. Her answers were very good and her demonstration and real life experiences was well recognizable in the answers she gave.

I didn't want to go into too depth of advanced questions because I felt like she would have some difficulty with those. Overall I think she's a perfectly fine mid-level developer and I would definitely hire her if given the opportunity.
