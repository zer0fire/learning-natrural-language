Today is Monday, it is June third today, and it is also cloudy. At this day I will finished my draft, even I write about five hundred words, but I also need to more until it reached about eight hundred words, it is not easy but I also need to do. At this evening, I will do two things, write test document for ai editor, I will spend about half an hour, and then I will try my best to finish the English video draft. This day I also review a video by an uploader from bilibili, I think it's very useful video, so I decide make some notes for this video, I will also do this at this evening.
