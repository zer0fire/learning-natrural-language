Today is Wednesday and it is also a sunny day today, the temperature will be back a high level according to the weather forecast. It is June fifth today, It has past quickly half of this year, it made me sigh with emotion. I need to finish a video this day and I need to finish test on my workload this day, and at this night I also need to finish the other project test, after all these things, I think maybe I can go to bed and have a nice sleep today. Oh I also need to do some exercise today, just like hiking or running
