Today is Monday, and it is sunny and hot, but I must went to another place to solve my unemployment compensation.
At the afternoon, I had a nice rest and I played video games. But today also happened a sad thing, My game controller were broken by myself. I try to fix this problem but I haven't fix it, so I have to buy a new controller to play games, so sad.
