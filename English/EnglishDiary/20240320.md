Today is March twentieth, the fifth work week of this year, it is Wednesday. Last night I felt so tired, so I had a relax and installed a video game, the Death Stranding Director Cut, and uninstalled the old version. and I also made some mistake, but finally I finished it. and I also made some practice at the Duolingo app, I think I also finished my mission yesterday. But today I think maybe I should do something just like watch some English video and make some note about video, I have started it about one week, so I need to restart it.
