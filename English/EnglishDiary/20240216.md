Today is Friday, it is also a holiday of the Spring Festival, it's the new start of my learning English and Coding
I need to write my new year plan, make a conclusion of my last year.
I will keep to learn English and learn Coding knowledge, and also I need to read some book more quickly
If I can read <Three-body Third> in one night, I can also finish other all book by read more quickly
