Today is Monday, I completed my plan last night, so I've decided to follow this plan and do something, for example I will learn some IELTS videos and write answers for interview about my project, trying to express it in several sentences. Additionally, I need to do some exercise, such as swimming, or just using some gym equipment, like treadmill.
