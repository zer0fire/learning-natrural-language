Today is Monday. it is July eighth today, and it is rain this morning, I love cloudy weather but I hate heavy rain, that made me can't ride bike and made my shoes and socks wet.
At this night I will finish my algorithm practice video, I found a fun leetcode question last evening and I write my draft for this question, it is maximum product of sub-array, This question has a easier solution than dynamic programming, I will try to explain this solution.
