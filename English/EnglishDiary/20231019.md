Today is Thursday, and this day is the one of the last two days that our team plan to eat together, but we have no target restaurant at  the latest. 
Yesterday I watched the English teacher Tiffani's video, and she introduced a English learning plan in the thirty days, this plan include five sections that about different content, include travel、work、food、relationship、at last success and failure. I thought these content is useful for my English speaking and learning, talk about these content made me transfer my thought to English fluency.
I also watched a video that published by Gigguk, he is a famous foreign anime youtuber


Some other English content, from a song that I like to listen recently, called <This Fffire>
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city
Burn how I burn
Paralyze controlling completely
