Today is another Friday, it's a good day, I can have a duvet day tomorrow, but I will keep learning at the weekend, try harder but I must to do improve my skill of English and Programming, keep optimistic
And, after the feeling, I should explain my new words
thick, it's a status about cloth or other thing, reverse word of thin
pale, it's first looks like white or sth, but actually it's like sb sick, the skin will reveal the sick status
determine, it's just looks like do sth promise bravely
Ok, it's all my today wanted to write, after this day, I'll try sth like extract other post or article, maybe it also can help me review or meet some new words quickly
