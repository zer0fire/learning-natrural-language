Today is Friday and it is rainy today. The temperature is between twenty one in twenty six, it is comfortable. Last night I made a mistake about having a bad conversation with other, so I decide to do some try to process this question, and I rethink about my fault on speaking something very strangely and very directly, I need to fix this disadvantage.
This weekend I also decide do some things about learning English, solve some algorithm questions, and try hard on my coding work (maybe a little about next.js and other about web3).
