Today is Thursday and I reserve a window repairing service at our householder. My window handle was dropped at the last time, I think it is rusty, so screw of the window is loose, it is a small thing but I was lazy to reserve a repairing, but why I was lazy? Actually I need to do more things, clean my freezer, repairing my chair and floor, swimming, When I thought them I felt very bored and I want to do more things made my happy. But you know what, At now I think keep a nice environment also need to do some bored things, event I don't want to do something, I'll talk with someone about these things to urge myself, I think it is a good idea
