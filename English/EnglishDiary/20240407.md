Today is Sunday, it is April seventh, and it is a work day today and I'm not good to know today is a work day. even I feel bad but I must finish my work, and I hope I can do something just like learning or practicing my skills, I was worried about my future life and my position, I want to be good and be happy, and I also want to have more time to relax, it is my final target to find a remote job.
