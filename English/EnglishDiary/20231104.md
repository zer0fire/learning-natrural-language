Today is Saturday, I think I have some rare experience of my life, I hadn't enough sleeping yesterday, so I felt too sensitive today, I found my life is so normal, I felt uneasy. I finished my English homework, and washed my clothes, and install the system of the raspberry pi, an embedded machine, I want to instal a arm linux in this machine
