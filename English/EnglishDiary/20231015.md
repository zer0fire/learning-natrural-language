Today is Sunday, the fifteenth day of October, I have learned English about three mouths, I found I have some little progress, just like I sound some English video or music, I could listen the word clearly, If the content is easy and daily, I could understand most of the content meaning. I think I must make more progress in my English learning, before next three mouth I must speak English fluency and use more new words to explain my opinion, and If I have a English interview, I can introduce myself fluency and answer the right result of the interview question.

First goal: Speak English fluency (By watch the video and learn English lesson)
Second goal: Answer right result (By read the react and next document, and read some interview books, like behavior question and system design)
