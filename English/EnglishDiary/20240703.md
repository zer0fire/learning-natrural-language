Today is Wednesday and it is July third. Last day it is rain, and the rain very heavy make temperature is down today. It is also half of work week total number in this year, maybe, I don't have a clear count. I feel so tired but I need to keep on because what, I have no many time? Actually I also have some time but I have no very clear target, I try to learn but I have no center of learn. I want to find a target by deep diving in learning
