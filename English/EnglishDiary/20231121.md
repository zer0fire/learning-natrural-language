Today is Tuesday, I felt too tired, it is fogy and the work place I move to is very close the door, when someone want to smoke, they will go out the door, but the smell of cigarettes still back in the room, when I smell the smoke, my nose very be worse. I hate these people is smoking in the public, it is disgusting
