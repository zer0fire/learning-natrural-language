Today is Thursday and it is August fifteenth today. Last night I played a video game called <Balatro>, it is a rogue-like video game and it is very funny for its random match in every round game. Today I plan to write some draft and also I will finish some features in my project.
And I also plan to play <The Witcher III: Wild Hunt>.
