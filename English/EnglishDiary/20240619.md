Today is Wednesday and it is cloudy this morning. It is June nineteenth today, last night I finished some web3 trainings. I have to produce a new video about programming tonight, At least I have to finished the draft, I think it have some effect for my English improving. This week I want to make a video about how to solve a leetcode question too, but I have to find some new ideas about my videos, because there are too many video in my published video, and I think it has a little repeat.
