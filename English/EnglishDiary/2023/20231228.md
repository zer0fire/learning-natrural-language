Today is Thursday and today I uploaded my leetcode practice result for the time record match, after that I have to talk about something about that I dreamed of when I was sleeping last night. I dreamed that I had more pressure on me, I had to find a new job for my life and my medicine, And that I was so terrible in the interview, I was very afraid of this, but I can't change. I think maybe this dream was because I really have much pressure on me yet, actually I also have some illness, but I can't give up on myself, maybe I just need some rest and more attempts for interviews and finding a new job, I just need more and more opportunities
