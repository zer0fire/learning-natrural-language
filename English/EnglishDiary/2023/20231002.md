Today is Monday but today also is a holiday, The National Festival holiday have passed four days. I went to a place near the SiChuan University and ate a lunch. In the subway, I saw so many people in the carriage. After the lunch, I went to Chengdu concert hall and I met a band by a chance, I think they are maybe a jazz band, they have many instrument. After that I went back my home, and have a rest until now
