Today is Tuesday, I will start working as usual. Yesterday evening our work group had a dinner together, we were going to a restaurant that serve Cantonese food, we enjoyed a happy time. I like eat Cantonese food, it is delicious and have many sea food, just like shrimp. I also did some English exercise yesterday evening, listened some English podcast or English lesson, it made listening English more clearly
