Today is Wednesday, and I have a trip planned for this weekend, I'll meet a friend, I think we should have a good time then, Maybe I'll take his choices into account and go to somewhere to play and try some new food.

After that I'll review the content that I learned last night:
Actions speak louder than words.
I have more money actually.
I would like to add something.
Would you like to add something?
