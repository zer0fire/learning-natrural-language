Today is Monday, and I felt some tired on writing diary, but I haven't find a remote job, I'm not resigned to on these things, I need more and more time and energy, to build a beautiful future, I need to try my best, someone already fall down this lazy and ugly life, but I can't do this, I should try more, I must be success on finding a remote job, I need it, and it also needs me, I'm a perfect remote freelancer, I want to meet more people, I want to go abroad, I want to play with my friend, I want to spend time with my parent and my grandparent, I want to spend more time on open source contribution, I want to do more things I want to do, I must find a best remote job for me
