Today is Monday, and this Monday I want to finish my kpi doc, or OKR doc, maybe it is hard for me, but I must start it. And our discount for BBQ is about to expire, I must send this message to my colleagues
And after that, It's time to explain new words
swear, means to use offensive or vulgar language, say sth let sb feel bad,
bitter, some flavor hard or sth is hard, as flavor is the opposite of the sweet
relieve, means to reduce or remove pain, stress or discomfort, relieve sth, just like pee
