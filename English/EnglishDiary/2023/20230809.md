Ok, a new Wednesday but I can't be happy cause I can't finished something(I have't excess energy to writing sentence) and something looks like I missed something (Hudson Sheng's remote job chance)

conviction, judge sb and let sb commit crime, other meaning is tough belief
lorry, the car of transport, big i
nonsense, talk some bad sentence or some silly sentence
pale, someone is sick, and maybe his skin is pale, looks like white
pile, a pile of paper, just a pile
provided, only sth be done then sth be done, just looks like mere, merely
