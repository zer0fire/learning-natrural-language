Today is Saturday, I feel I get in a wired loop, I want to learn but I think it is maybe is a wrong direction, I try to find a direction but I couldn't find a right learning direction. I trapped in my place, but maybe Longfeihu is right, I have a some progress, I just too anxiety, I should try my best, I want to change my life, pursue some pure dream, pursue many things I want to do
