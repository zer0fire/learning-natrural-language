Today is Thursday, And I want to get some motivation, I set a goal for myself to achieve. I try to encourage my mate to learn English. I describe a scene of him going to a beautiful beach with a girl in a foreign country, and also I describe how I would like to have a rest and travel to many countries that I want to go if I get a remote job.

After writing my diary, I start the next chapter that I explain the new words that I learned just now

economic, economic overheat, about all people selling or buying action
resistance, resist noun
financial, finance, For example: The financial crisis might be over
