Today is a bad Tuesday, I try hard to finish my work and avoid working overtime, but maybe I have no relaxation time, I hate this work environment. Everyone wants to me must do things more quickly„ÄÅ more faster but nobody cares about the redundancy and quality. Maybe it's time to leave this environment, I need to find some chance to get a new work and get out of this bad feeling
