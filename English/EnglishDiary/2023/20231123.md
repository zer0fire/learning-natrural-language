Ok, it is another fogy day, I was meet about three days are fogy, Today, Thursday is also a fogy day, the air pollution is so serious but no one can do something, we were only wait the wind blow away the pollution. maybe I should wear the mask when I go to work and get off work. I also need to drink more water.
