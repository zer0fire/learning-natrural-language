At the beginning of this day, I connected with my teacher to discussion my career, and I want to get a remote job now
And after that It was the explaining new words chapter
enthusiastic, feel very excited and happy about sb or sth ?

significance, just like important
strip, a piece of paper, some thin area etc
favor, more like prefer but I think it's the verb of favorite
