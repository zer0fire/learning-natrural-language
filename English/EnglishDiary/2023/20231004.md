Today is Wednesday, and I have three or four days left my holiday. Today I also have a date with my colleague. I also want to play some video games today. That's maybe a boring day, but I also do some learning English exercise
I want to share a English training about English reading and listening, let you brain in a a English environment, that's a so good idea
