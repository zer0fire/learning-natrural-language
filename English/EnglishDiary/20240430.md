Today is Tuesday and it is cloudy, it is April thirty, the last day of this month. The time slip so quick and I think it is very hard to hold. Last night I watched a video about the boss of NVIDIA. He said the first principle of the his company is finding something are joy or new, these things will help his company finding new direction, new fashion of the future. But he also said something just like passionate, genially? I didn't understand those things so I can't explain the meaning of those things.
