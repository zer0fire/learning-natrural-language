Today is Sunday, and it is also the first work day of our country. It should be a new first day of my job, and I will do some hard working at this day, A good idea for me is divide my time be some parts, and I choose the 10am to 12am as my golden time, I will choose some creative and difficult job, just like write some new content, make some target of my work, learn English, design the develop content and so on.
On the afternoon, I will do some writing job or some modify job, or read some books or articles
