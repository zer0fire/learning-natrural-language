Today is Friday and it is the end of the sixteenth work week. We also have two days to relax and do something else. I plan to replace my phone protector film, and have a good lunch tomorrow. Last night I also finished my draft about new leetcode tutorial video. When this June twenty first, I want to wish me have a good birthday when it is June twenty sixth.
