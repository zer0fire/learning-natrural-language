I'm very quickly to try to understand a new language that is not my mother tough, It's difficult to understanding and It's not easy, but maybe it is simple, not many grammar, not many words, I just want to communication with a local people, or a man that meet me in a interview. Directing by the Kungfu English lessons, I want to know more and more English knowledge and will have some change to have a conversation with a native speaker

Since I was a children, I just wanted to communication with some foreigner, I'm so curious with the foreign knowledge. but until I'm be older, I just want to refuse these feeling, and now I think the feeling is back, I have confidence speak English with foreigners, maybe There are many people I'll meet them, I'm excited to meet many things

Somehow
Deliver
Master
Most easy
I spend
