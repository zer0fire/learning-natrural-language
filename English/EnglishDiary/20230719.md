let me find sth, find sth and have a rest, so I can find my way to cross the end

I feel so fear, worried about more my life

Now I'm at area that fill fear, sth wrong but no one can correct it

I feel I must learn beacause I feel so fear, I'm fear

a piece of RSC post for React, written by Dan

In this technical deep dive, we'll implement a very simplified version of React Server Components(RSC) from scratch.

This deep dive will be published in several parts

- Part 1: Server Components(this page)
- Part 2: Client Components (not written yet)
- Part 3: TBD (not written yet)
