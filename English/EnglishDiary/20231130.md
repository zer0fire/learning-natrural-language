Today is Thursday and it is also the final day of the November, I have learning English about four month. Actually I think something was happened in this month, I think I have more courage to speak English and talk with somebody fluency, I think I open my mouth and I can use English to think, so I will be better in speaking English, it's a good news for me, Maybe at the next step, I'll take a interview in English, and I'll be a perfect candidate for all jobs I want to have
