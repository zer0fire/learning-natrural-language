Today is Sunday, and it is also cloudy today. Maybe it will have a heavy rain because the cloud is too thick and the sun light was covered by cloud. Today I'm going to eat some good meal, make a video about leetcode question, I think I need to keep to do exercise like speaking and reading in English.
Last week I try to finish the project and I plan to have a meeting with my friend next week, this meeting will be about learning and making some progress
