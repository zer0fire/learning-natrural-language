Today is Thursday, and it is also too hot. I have a failed interview recently so I try to cure my tired, so I plan to swim today. But when I went to swimming pool, there are too many people in same pool, so I decided to ride bike and go back my home. There are some bad things in my life, but I think it will be better in my life.
