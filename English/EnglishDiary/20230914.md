Today is Thursday and I found I have been learning English for two mouths
But I feel nothing has changed in my life. I just increased my vocabulary but other things have not changed, I seem to be able to listen more conversation, but I don't have the courage to speak English
I don't know how some people can improve English quickly in three or two mouths, I think they maybe spend more time learning English and practicing to speaking
I must do more things, but I feel tired, even writing a diary everyday makes me feel bored
If you try hard to do something but you don't see any obvious result, you may also feel tired and bored like me
Alright, even though I said these things, I'm not giving up on learning English. I will keep on chasing, pursuing my dream.
If two mouths can't make me change, I will spend more time, three mouths、four mouths、half a year... I will be a successful programmer who have a nice remote job
