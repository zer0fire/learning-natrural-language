Today, also another Thursday, I should finish my algorithm training and I should keep holding on writing diary everyday
Today I also meet some new words.
Like conviction, it's meaning is let sth get judged because crime
infection, like covid-19 is a type of infection
arrange, do sth for ready to sth
accurate, looks like certainly
thick, a reverse side of thin, usually use in cloth
finance, just like economy,
satisfaction, let sth feel best right
outcome, just like result
Okay, this is my today learning result, I also want to improve my speed in English, but I think it's harder, maybe I should insist to find a way
