Today is Friday and I think I'm very tired at this week because I worked about six days. Last day I read a interview about the Boston Dynamics AI institute founder, it is difficult but funny, he is talking about cognitive intelligence and perception of the robots, it is very important for the robots to be more powerful and convenient for our life. I often think what is our future daily life, I think the robots with high cognitive intelligence is very important in that life. After that I make a conclusion, write the conclusion in my e-notes, and I also take a online test of Duolingo at the night, it is also very helpful for me.
