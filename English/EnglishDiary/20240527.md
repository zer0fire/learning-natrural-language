Today is Monday and it is the first work day of this week, I'm very excited because it is cloudy today, that means maybe the temperature will be down, and I will turn of my air controller when I sleep at night. Last night I wrote a draft about new algorithm video, but maybe today I will also write a draft about how to use next, I still don'n determine what I want to do, I will determine it at this afternoon.
