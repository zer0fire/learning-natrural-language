Today is Wednesday, I just keep going on my work. Today is cloudy and I also think how to dive in the rust or wasm, and I also want to build a next.js application and deploy it. Although By use 'next start' command, I can easily to deploy the next application just like a little practice, but I want to dive in the CI/CD layer or process protected layer, it is including the gitlab ci/cd file, pm2 -- the tool of the process protected and many other tools, I want to practice to use them
