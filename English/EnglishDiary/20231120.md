Today is Monday, I keep on learning English almost five mouths, but I think I have little progress, it is maybe made me said, but I also know I haven't use all time in learning English, event though I joined the Kung-fu English course, I joined the group to writing diary, I join the group that have activity is reciting words, but I just spent less time than I was a student, I think it is the important thing, I can't spend more time on learning English, OK, now I must make a choice, talking with my mentor and telling him I want to quit after next job cut, I must be better
