Today is Wednesday, I feel very different of my daily life, I feel very angry for many things, I need to calm down and rethink about many things. Last day I move to my new house and I sleep at my new house, actually it smelled a little bad, but I think I just sleep one night, and tomorrow I will open the window to swap the air, and after that I'll use something to remove these smelling.
