Today is Wednesday, and I want to play game and watch anime this day. And I also need to finish my plan that is uploading my video, so I should do some after effect before upload.
And then I should write some code for my front-end optimization code repository. And then I also want to write code for my Next.js application.
Today I also fix a bug that is happened on @tiptap/react library. The low version (2.3.2) library includes useEditor hook but this hook hasn't 'immediatelyRender' property or option, so I try to find a higher version, and I got a information that is 2.5.0 version has been published that has this property, so I update the library to this version.
