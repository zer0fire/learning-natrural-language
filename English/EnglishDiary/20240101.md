Today is New year's day and I'm happy to learn some English, after that I call my family and we give each us some blessings and wishes at this year. Finally I buy a video game as the gift for me, it called Bauldurs's gate Third, it looks like very funny game but after some time I just found it maybe not very fit my hobby, maybe I need some discover for it, it just looks like a DND game, I like DND game but I don't like too many message on other mission that I can't finish them
