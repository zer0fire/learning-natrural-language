Today is Sunday and it is sunny today. It is April twenty eighth and I must go to work because If we have a long holiday we must use weekend fill up our work to in China, it is a very bad principle and we hate it, but nobody can change it. I hate this type to give our poor holiday, especially occupy our weekend
