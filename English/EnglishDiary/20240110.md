Today is Wednesday, There is not anything interesting in my daily life. Recently I have been read some source code at ni's github repository. And I also play the game called Baldur's Gate which is funny, but maybe I need some guide for it. I also watched a stream about The Last of Us, In Chinese translation, it was translated as the meaning of America's end days, which is a very funny mistake
