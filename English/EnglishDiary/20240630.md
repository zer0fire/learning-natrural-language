Today is the last day of this month, and It also means I past half of this year. I think I do some changes in my daily life, because I write diary more frequently and more adaptable, and I can also describe more and more complex and abstract things by my word. Ok, after this conclusion, I will keep on my things, and I also need to find something new that I'm interested in, I played video games this afternoon and I practiced my English in this evening. I also do some exercise to help me reduce my weight.
