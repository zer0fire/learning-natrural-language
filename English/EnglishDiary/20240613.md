Today is Thursday and it is sunny day today, but when the afternoon, it was cloudy and raining. So far I have about write diary one year, I think it has a little helpful for my English improving, but it also used a little time in a day, so I will keep going on this, and I also need try to read more English content and write some draft about content conclusion or video tutorial, they are more helpful for me in English speaking practicing
