Today is Monday. Last night I played video game, and I unlock all maps of this new DLC for the Elder Ring. Even I had some hard problems in my way to unlock these maps, but I watched some video about the way to unlock all maps, and I tried to do some discover of myself, finally I finished this achievement in this game. And I also do something made all NPCs moved again, before this try they seemed very friendly, but they have no movement to push story go forward, so this the only way to push all things happened, even as the video content, there is a meaningful ending in this game.
