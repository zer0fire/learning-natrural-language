Today is Thursday and it is a sunny today, after about a week cloudy or rainy weather, we meet a day with sun finally. Last night our group have a meal and we choose to take a BBQ buffet. I have a good meal but I also think it is too oily for me. This day I need to go to hospital and have a check for my body, ask my doctor and buy some new medicines, wish I have a good progress.
