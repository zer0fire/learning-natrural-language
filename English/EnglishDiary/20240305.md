Today is Tuesday, I move all my stuff to my new house today. At this night I will take some picture of my old house, and then collect other things to move or throw.
I'm not brag it out that I move all my things at two days. I think it is very hard for me but I need to do. Today I'll learn something about Browser runtime and English, I need take a Duolinguo mock test at this week as well. I will not overthinking anymore about move to a new house.
