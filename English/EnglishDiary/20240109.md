Today is Tuesday and I buy my ticket to back to home yesterday evening, I think maybe it's too early but maybe I just make a decide to let me buy the cheap ticket as early as possible.
last night I learnt some English sentence and I feel I have some gain about English sentence, There are some pattern that I wrote in my notes:

Sorry to bother you, Sorry to interrupt
Between you and me
Pay the bill
I give you the benefit of the doubt
