Today is Wednesday, It's raining and I hate these raining days, because the all clothes will be wet and even though the air is wet, I can't stand these wet air and wet clothes, these wet things make the magic damage to me, I feel sad and disgusting, the weather beat me.
I also do some English learning at this morning, read some English sentence, remember some new words and so on
