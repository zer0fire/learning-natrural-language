Today is Wednesday, I forgot to finish my diary last day, but fortunately I remember to finish my diary today. Last day I read an article about giving compliments, it mentioned about some scientific proof about giving and receiving compliments will make people feel better and release some pleasurable neurotransmitters like dopamine and oxytocin, maybe I also need giving some compliments and receiving some compliments, make me reduce pressure.
