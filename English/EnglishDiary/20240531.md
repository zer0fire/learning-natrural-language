Today is Friday and it is a good day today, it is cloud so it still have some sun rays but it is not very strong, I feel it is good. Today is the last day of May this year, and it is also the last work day of the fifteenth work week, If this year have about fifty-two weeks, this year past about one third, I also have little progress on my English and work for a course, and I also need to find a good way to contribute open-source and my work skills.
