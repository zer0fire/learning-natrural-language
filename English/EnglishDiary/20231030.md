Today is Monday, I have nothing want to share, but maybe I can say something about the world. Last day I read a content about Chinese community canteen, it said more young guys want to go to community canteen than the elders, because most of young people want to spend less money in our daily life. More Chinese community canteen are opened by the community member, There are provide multiple food, some meat dish, some vegetarian dish, and fresh rice
Actually I also hope I can find these type canteen, it has a wallet-friendly price, now I must eat at a canteen called "XiangCunJi" nearby my company, it is a little bit expensive, but it is also have multiple food.
