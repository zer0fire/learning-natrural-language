Today is Tuesday and it is a cloudy and windy day too, the weather make me feel so bad but I also have some hope for something others
Last day I try insert the katex -- a JavaScript library of parse latex expression in my project, it is difficult but maybe it's a good idea. I also want to try make a demo of cocos-dnd and low-code platform, on the top of that maybe I also need to try to review my resume, and I need to apply some new work position.
