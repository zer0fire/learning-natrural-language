Today is Sunday, it is also too hot but the temperature is lower than before, I think it is a good news. Today I plan to join a interview and I will learn swimming at 5pm this afternoon. At this night, I will review my interview progress and do some notes about it. And I will also learn English this afternoon and this night, just like read some English content, listen some podcast and so on. And I think I need a regular plan to use my time in my each day
