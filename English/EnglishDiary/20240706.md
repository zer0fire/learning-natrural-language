Today is Saturday and it is also a nice day today, I had a good sleep last night, but it is also cloudy today. it is July sixth, this month has been past about one third, is it a bad news? I don't think so, but I feel so numb, and I don't want to learn anything today, maybe I should do some good relax. This afternoon I also find some leetcode questions to do, hope I can get some funny in these questions.
