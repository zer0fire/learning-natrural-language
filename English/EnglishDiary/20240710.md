Today is Wednesday, and it has heavy rain this morning, even until now, I feel helpless in my learning experience last night, I need more time to input more and more English to help me grow in English, but I have no time to do these things. I need a new job, it will help me have same incoming as now and it should have more holiday, or free time to make me grow up more quickly than now
