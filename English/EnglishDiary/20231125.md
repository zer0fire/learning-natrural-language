Today is Saturday, and This morning I play a game called Spell Disks, it is a game that combine multiple spells and some time's trigger of the spells, it is a interesting independent game, I recommend everyone who like the rouge-like games play it, it is also a like Vampire survivor game, these type of games's playing method is the player move the character position and the character shoot the bullet automatically.
