Today is Tuesday and it is the final day at the October, so it is the 31th October. It is also fogy day, and I have no special emotion. At this evening our group give a tech share about web assembly, it is maybe funny. Today I also buy a sd card, I think I can use it to install a kali linux and run at my raspberry pi
