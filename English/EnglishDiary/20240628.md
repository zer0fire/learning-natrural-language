Today is Friday, another Friday in June, today is June twenty eighth and I do listen some English pods in this morning. It is also cloudy and cool today, there is a comfortable weather in Chengdu. I'm going to clinic tonight and inject my medicine.
And I also prepare to play some video game, and eat a good meal.
Hope this day I have a good relax. I will do my homework, such as write some code for logger system and some contract code for web3 development.
