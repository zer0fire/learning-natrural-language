Actually I have learned English about 5 months, it's a interesting news, and I think maybe I have some progress, I can listen more complex English sounds, and do more complex writing, even I just use may break time to learn. I still remember at the start, I need to search how to spell the day of week's calling, now I feel I have some progress, not too much, but I have some, I tried hard to do, and had some gain, it's alright. Of course at the end I also hope I have more gain when I learn more
