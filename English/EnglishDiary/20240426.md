Today is Friday, and it is cloudy today, I think I have allergic symptom this morning, because I feel so itch in my skin and it has been rash, I try to think what happened on my body, but nothing special this morning, maybe it is just a little error in my body. Last night I also find my proxy service stop, the provider maybe get my cash and run away, it's a bad news, but fortunately I have some friends with me, and we can find a new provider
