Today is Sunday and it is May twenty sixth today, this week is passed so quickly, it is also so hot today, I hope it to be cooler than now. This day I played some game and I also went to a meetup this afternoon, it about web3 products but I didn't very understand these contents, but I also have some reward. At nightfall, I went to gym and swam, took some exercises. Hope I can have big progress on my English.
