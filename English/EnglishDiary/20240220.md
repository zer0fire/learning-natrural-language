Today is Tuesday, I should finish my work and after that I should do something to pass the Duolingo test. If I can't pass the Duolingo test, some other plan of going abroad will never fly, but maybe it's not very hard thing, I just pass the mock test last night and get the score about 70 to 90, it is equal the IELTS score from 4.5 to 5, it's not a vert good starting but I also stepped the first stage
