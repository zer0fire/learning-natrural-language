Today is Wednesday and it is July seventeenth, I wrote my diary and keep it up about one year. I think it is a good achievement, even I just have a little progress in my English but I think it is also a improvement. I just have a little time to learn in a year, I have to use my free time to learn English and watch English learning video, keep to listen English pod, and write a little diary in my work time, But I also have a little improvement before one year ago. I think it is a good starting, I must speak English fluently one day
