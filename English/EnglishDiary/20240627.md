Today is Thursday and it is June twenty seventh today, it is rain again this morning. Last night I learned some phrase in Echo app, I talked with Sherry and she helped me teach some phrase or sentences format just like "Couldn't put it down", "it isn't my coffee", "it is right up my alley", "it is blew my mind" and so on, some sentence formats and phrase. I'm ensure these things help me speak English more fluency and more like a native speaker
