Today is bad Tuesday, I try hard to finish my work and avoid work overtime, but maybe I have no relaxation time, I hate this work environment, everyone want to you must do sth more quick more fast but nobody care the redundancy and quality, maybe it's time to leave this environment, I must to find some chance out of this bad feeling
