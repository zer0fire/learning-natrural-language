Today is Sunday, I went to hospital at the early morning, and after that I have a good meal in the noon. At the afternoon, I played a game called PalWorld, it looks very like Pokemon with some gameplay from the video game Ark and Rust, they were usually be treated as the presents of survival and building games, it is really good to play
