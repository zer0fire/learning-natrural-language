There are a few key considerations when designing a logging system for an e-commerce site that needs to be highly available and handle a large volume of traffic.

First, the system needs to be designed for scalability. This means that it should be able to easily handle an increase in traffic without requiring a complete redesign.

Second, the system needs to be highly available. This means that it should be designed to continue functioning even if parts of it fail.

Third, the system needs to be able to handle a large volume of data. This means that it should be able to store and process a large amount of data efficiently.

Fourth, the system needs to be able to provide useful information. This means that the data that is logged should be able to be used to improve the site or diagnose problems.
